* The load commands directly follow the mach_header.  The total size of all
* of the commands is given by the sizeofcmds field in the mach_header.  All
* load commands must have as their first two fields cmd and cmdsize.  The cmd
* field is filled in with a constant for that command type.  Each command type
* has a structure specifically for it.  The cmdsize field is the size in bytes
* of the particular load command structure plus anything that follows it that
* is a part of the load command (i.e. section structures, strings, etc.).  To
* advance to the next load command the cmdsize can be added to the offset or
* pointer of the current load command.  The cmdsize for 32-bit architectures
* MUST be a multiple of 4 bytes and for 64-bit architectures MUST be a multiple
* of 8 bytes (these are forever the maximum alignment of any load commands).
* The padded bytes must be zero.  All tables in the object file must also
* follow these rules so the file can be memory mapped.  Otherwise the pointers
* to these tables will not work well or at all on some machines.  With all
* padding zeroed like objects will compare byte for byte.
